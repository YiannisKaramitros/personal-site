# Intro

I am Yiannis Karamitros, a senior Computer Science Engineering major at Lehigh University with a minor in Economics. I originally grew up in Doylestown, Pennsylvania but have family all over the globe. As the first person in my family to attend a standard 4-year college degree I always thought I was special and wanted to show that. I love pushing myself in ways of taking graduate classes as an undergrad or participating in personal coding projects. My fascination of technology started when I was a young boy playing video games, it then grew into me building my very own computer in middle school and now I am about to graduate with a Computer Science degree!
